digitRecognition
================

This is the first project of the Spring 2014 CS 61C (Machine Structures) class at UC Berkeley. It implements digit recognition in images with support for flipped and rotated digits. It also supports the conversion of a dense image matrix to sparse (in C) and viceversa (in MIPS).
