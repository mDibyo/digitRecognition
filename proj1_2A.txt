CS61C Spring 2014 Project 1-2 Task A Writeup

1. Which version (iterative or recursive) executed more instructions, and why? Please answer in 1-2 sentences.

The recursive version executed more instructions than the iterative version (9068 vs. 8830 for the stopping time of 39) since the recursive version has to execute more instructions every time it makes a call to itself to store non-temporary variables. In general, function calls require extra instruction calls. There are no function calls in the collatz function in the iterative version.
