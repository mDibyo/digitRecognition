# --------------------- DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ABOVE THIS POINT ---------------------

# Returns the stopping time of the Collatz function (the number of steps taken till the number reaches one)
# using an ITERATIVE approach. This means that if the input is 1, your function should return 0.
#
# The initial value is stored in $a0, and you may assume that it is a positive number.
# 
# Make sure to follow all function call conventions.
